Welcome to Bravo XO, a dating app for all fans of the Bravo Reality Universe aka the Bravoverse!
Choose your favorite reality franchise and start chatting with other singles of a similar mind.

Our bio section allows users to get to know you better before chatting: are you in control of your life like Captain Sandy? Can you cook like chef Tom?
Do you like to take off your sweater in a parking lot? Do you have insults for days when riding a bus? Would you leak pet rescue drama to the press?

We can't gurantee you'll find a Brittany Cartwright or a Joe Gorga, but there's a good chance you'll find a Jax or Vicki (because let's face it, we're all a little crazy if we're on this site, alright?)

As a user, I can:

* Sign up to gain access
* Complete the remainder of my profile( Bio, Show, Sexuality, Pronouns); it persists to the database.
* Login in securely (authentication and authorization).
* Chat to other users throughout the app via email (ActionCable messaging is still WIP)
