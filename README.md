Welcome to Bravo XO, a dating app for all fans of the Bravo Reality Universe (BRU)!
Choose your favorite reality franchise and start chatting with other singles of a similar mind.

Filter out users that are closer to your own Villa Rosa with geo-location.

Our bio section allows users to get to know you better before chatting: are you in control of your life like Captain Sandy? Can you cook like chef Tom?
Do you like to take off your sweater in a parking lot? Do you have insults for days when riding a bus? Would you leak pet rescue drama to the press?

We can't gurantee you'll find a Brittany Cartwright or a Joe Gorga, but there's a good chance you'll find a Jax or Vicki (because let's face it, we're all a little crazy if we're on this site, alright?)

As a user, I can:

* Sign up to gain access
* Complete the remainder of my profile( Bio, Favorite show, Sexuality, Pronouns); it persists to the database.
* Login in securely (authentication and authorization).
* Set up my preferences: sexuality, age, distance from me.
* Filter results based on those preferences.
* Like other users in my category.
* Change distance and age preferences with a drop down filter.
* Chat to other users based on my preferences within my categories (sexuality, age, etc.)

STRETCH GOALS
* Set up a date with that user through a calendar function.
* Create a trivia quiz that provides you with a character result that is added to your profile.
